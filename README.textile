h1. jQuery PageSlide

PageSlide is a jQuery plugin which slides a webpage over to reveal an additional interaction pane.

h2. Demo

There are a couple of examples included with this package. Or, if you can't wait to download it, see it live on the "responsive demo":http://srobbin.github.com/jquery-pageslide or "original project page":http://srobbin.com/blog/jquery-pageslide/.

h2. Options

h3. speed

The speed at which the page slides over. Accepts standard jQuery effects speeds (e.g. 'fast', 'normal' or milliseconds). (default=200)

h3. direction

Which direction does the page slide? Accepts 'left' or 'right'. (default='right')

h3. modal

By default, when pageslide opens, you can click on the document to close it. If modal is set to 'true', then you must explicitly close PageSlide using $.pageslide.close(); (default=false)

h3. iframe

By default, linked pages are loaded into an iframe. Set this to false if you don't want an iframe. (default=true)

h3. href

Override the source of the content. Optional in most cases, but required when opening pageslide programmatically (e.g. <code>$.pageslide({ href: '#some-element' });</code> ) (default=null)

h3. disableRefresh

Is the content is refreshed each time we open the Pageslide. (default=false)

h2. Setup

In the HEAD tag:
<pre><code><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="jquery.pageslide.css"></code></pre>

Ideally, near the bottom of the page.
<pre><code><script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.pageslide.min.js"></script>
</code></pre>

To use, call pageslide on an <code><a></code> tag that either links to a page or an anchor of a hidden element.
<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
    $('a').pageslide();
</script>
</code></pre>

Or, open pageslide programatically:
<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
    $.pageslide({ href: '#some-element' });
    $.pageslide({ href: 'some-page.html' });
</script>
</code></pre>

To close pageslide programatically:
<pre><code><script type="text/javascript">
    $.pageslide.close();
</script>
</code></pre>
